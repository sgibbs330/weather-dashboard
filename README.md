Weather Dashboard

I used the weather API given to create a weather dashboard that allows the user to look up cities around the world to see their current weather, as well as their 5 day weather forcast. 

- I created a simple, user friendly layout.
- When a city is input into the search bar, it will save into local storage and list below the search bar.
- The location, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index are all displayed in the current weather information.
- The date, temperature, and humidity are displayed in the 5 day forcast.
- I created  media screen code that allows for the application to format to smaller screens.
